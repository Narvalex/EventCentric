1. A new table, like
EventStore.OcaccionallyConnectedClients
StreamType			| DateTime
ProductorElzevir
With this table we can register the OCCProxy, and with the subscription tables we can register 
the current ECVersion of each OCC
The proxy registers in the singleton OCCProxy

2. The severs subscribers polls IInMemoryPublisher, when polling, they updates the OCCProxy in what ECVersion number
they are already.

3. The Client, when online, they try to issue a get to the OCCProxy to get the current ECVersion, the first time 
they tell that they do not know with number they have. When getting a response, they save in memory the number of the
ECVersion of the server. With that information they post the new events from that version on. After posting, 
they polls for an update of the ECVersion of the server.

4. When updated they try to post again.
